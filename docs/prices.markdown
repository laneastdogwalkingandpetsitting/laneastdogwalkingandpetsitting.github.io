title: Prices
---
We try to keep our prices as transparent as possible. For customers within 10 mile-ish radius of us, we charge £15 per hour and £10 for pop in visits (usually last about 20 mins), but a little extra for customers further away - see below.

<table>
<tr><td>1 hour dog walk</td><td>£15 per hour</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 hour dog walk for an additional dog from the same household</td><td>£6 per hour</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 hour daytime pet sitting</td><td>£15 per hour</td></tr>
<tr><td>1 hour horse related<br/>
  <span style="font-size:smaller">Feeding/checking horse, poo picking, etc.</span></td><td>£15 per hour</td></tr>
<tr><td><a href="overnightpetsitting.html">Overnight pet sitting</a><br/>
  <span style="font-size:smaller">Doesn't include walking dogs. When I come to your house at 6pm, it's to feed your pets and settle down, not head out again. Please book a dog walk as extra.</span></td><td>£65 per night no matter how many pets</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pop in visits<br/>
  <span style="font-size:smaller">To check and feed your cat/small animal. A visit lasting about 20 mins.</span>
</td><td>£10 per visit</td></tr>
</table>
 
For customers further away, we charge a little extra due to the extra time needed to get to and from you (and the fuel). Usually this is £6 extra per visit, but please [contact us](/contactus/) for a quote.

<h2>Days we work</h2>
We try to keep most of our work to Monday to Friday, but of course if a customer is going away, animals still need looking after so we work weekends too. We try to work a reduced schedule (not that it ends up reduced sometimes). If you'd like to make use of our services on a weekend, or indeed bank holiday, just do get [in touch](/contactus/) and ask.
