Both Hannah and Rich are animal lovers, especially Hannah and for many years have had their own pets. Dog & cats mainly, but have also kept various others too. 

Hannah has always wanted to work with animals, but circumstances have meant it's not been always been possible.

The seed of the business began a few years ago when a local dog owner, neigbour of a friend of Hannah asked if Hannah could walk their dog while they were at work. At this point Hannah was working part time herself, but agreed to do this when she finished work as and when needed.

Then, in September 2022, another dog owner was looking for someone to help walk their dog and Hannah was recommended. From there, we wondered if perhaps dog walking might be something which could be taken up a full time and so we asked the question on Facebook if anyone was interested and ... the flood gates opened!

So, Laneast dog walking and pet sitting began. We purchased insurance, Hannah handed in her notice from her part time job and for then next month, worked mornings at her kitchen assistant job, then jumped in her car and went meeting new customers, walking dogs, finishing around 6pm every day.

By the time of Hannah's last day at work, she already had full days of work in the diary. She'd was grateful not having delayed handing in her notice. She continued pushing ahead, expecting things to calm down at some point, but it didn't and so in January 2023, Rich made the decision to join the business, and we formed a business partnership.

Between us we have an extensive knowledge of all sorts of pets and animals, so the business has continued to grow since, with some customers asking us to walk their dog daily, some to look after their horses and goats while away, others to do the same for their chickens. It does give some variety to our days!
