Laneast dog walking and pet sitting consists of Hannah and Rich, husband and wife, business partners.

The business started proper around September 2022, but prior to this, for a year or more, Hannah had been helping a local dog owner  by walking their dog while they were at work. Then, in September, another dog owner was looking for someone to help walk their dog and Hannah was recommended. From there, we wondered if perhaps dog walking might be something which could be taken up full time and we started asking on Facebook for anyone interested and the flood gates opened!

So, Laneast dog walking and pet sitting began. We purchased insurance, Hannah handed in her notice from her part time job and began by working 8am till mid-day as a kitchen assistant, then jumped in her car and went meeting new customers and walking dogs, finishing around 6pm every day.

By the time of Hannah's last day at work, she already had a full diary. She continued pushing ahead, expecting things to calm down at some point, but it didn't and so has grown to the point that it could support 2 people, so in January 2023, Rich left his job and joined the business, forming a business partnership with Hannah.

Between us we have an extensive knowledge of all sorts of pets and animals, so the business has continued to grow since, with some customers asking us to walk their dog daily, some to look after their horses and goats while away, others to do the same for their chickens. It does give some variety to our days!
