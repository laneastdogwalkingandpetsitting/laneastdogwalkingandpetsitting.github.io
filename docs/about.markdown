Both Hannah and Rich are animal lovers, especially Hannah and for many years have had their own pets. Dog & cats mainly, but have also 
kept various others too. 

Hannah has always wanted to work with animals, but circumstances have meant it's not been always been possible.

The seed of the business began a few years ago when a local dog owner, a friend of a friend asked Hannah if she could walk their dog 
while they were at work. At this point Hannah was working part time herself, but agreed to do this when she finished work as and when needed.

Fast forward to September 2022, another local dog owner was looking for someone to help walk their dog and Hannah was recommended. 
From there, we wondered if perhaps dog walking might be something which there was enough need in the area and could be taken up as a full time job,
so we asked the question on Facebook if anyone was interested and the flood gates opened!

So, Laneast dog walking and pet sitting began. We purchased dog walking and pet sitting insurance, Hannah handed in her notice from her part time job and for then next month, worked mornings at her kitchen assistant job, then jumped in her car and went meeting new customers, walking dogs, finishing around 6pm every day.

By the time of Hannah's last day at work, she already had a full diary. She'd was grateful not having delayed handing in her notice. 
She continued pushing ahead, expecting things to calm down at some point, but it hasn't, so around Chrismas 2022, Rich made the decision 
to join the business, and we formed a business partnership.

Between us we have an extensive knowledge of all sorts of pets and animals. Hannah from all the pets we've had, working in an exotic pet 
shop and small animal breeder and Rich comes from a farming background.

We're really pleased the business has continued to grow, with some customers asking us to walk their dog daily or weekly, some to look after their 
horses and goats while they are away, others to do the same for their chickens and ducks. It certainly gives variety to our days!
