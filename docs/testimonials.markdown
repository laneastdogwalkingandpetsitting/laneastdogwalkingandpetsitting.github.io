We asked some of our customers if they would mind giving us a testimonial:

> "We have used Laneast dog walking and sitting services for over a year now and have always found Hannah and Rich to be kind, considerate and utterly trustworthy. Our dogs absolutely adore them. They take the time to understand what we and the dogs need, and are always willing to help at short notice if they can. They’ve walked their dogs with ours to help settle them in and socialise them. We are extremely grateful for their support. We have no hesitation in recommending them for dog walking and sitting services."

> "Hannah provides a brilliant service for animal care, I have left my horses,goats and chickens in her care several times now,I can honestly say I am totally relaxed when I’m away knowing that Hannah is caring for them, she is very reliable and very reasonably priced. Just really glad I have found Hannah it means I can go away more !!"

> "We are so happy with the care and attention you provided and the photo updates we received. You can tell from the angles that you really interacted with Bluey and gave him lots of quality time! We had a much nicer time away knowing he was in such safe hands. Thank you Hannah xx"
