When we walk your dog, we will walk it for an hour, either somewhere near your home, or if you are happy for us to drive your dog, we can take it to somewhere your dog will enjoy. Our vehicle is equipped with crates to put your dog inside or for larger dogs, or dogs that don't like crates, a large boot area.

In Summer, on a hot day, we prefer walking your dog under tree cover so there is shade and ideally with a stream/river where your dog is not going to get too hot and can takle a dip if they wish. In any case, we keep a water supply in our vehicle so we can give your dog a drink if they need it.

Sometimes we will walk your dog with other dogs, but first we check to ensure that all dogs in a group have the correct behaviour and temperament to do so. We try not to walk too many dogs at the same time, eg no more than 4 where different households are mixed. As we are a husband and wife team, we often jointly take out groups of dogs together.
