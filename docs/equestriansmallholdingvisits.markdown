# Horses
Hannah has years of experience of keeping horses; she has 4 herself. So if you need help with your horses, for example you need to go on holiday, rest assured that Hannah can look after your horses while you are away.

# Small holding
We've looked after a number of small holders animals while they are away. In addition to horses we've looked after:
- pigs
- goats
- sheep
- poultry (ducks & chickens)

Plus of course, water their greenhouse/veg plots, check on their cats, feed the fish, etc. If you have an animal not listed here, do [get in touch](/contactus/), we may be able to help.

We charge our usual rate of £15 per hour for customers within a 10 mile-ish radius, but a little extra (£6) for customers further out.
