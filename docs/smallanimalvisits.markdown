title: Small animal/cat visits

Hannah has experience of a wide variety of small animals, both from having them as pets herself and working at stables, kennels, pet shops and volunteering with the RSPCA:

- cats (we have a few ourselves)
- rabbits
- snakes
- hamsters
- gerbils
- chinchillas
- guinea pigs
- rats
- pond fish
- tropical fish

If you need someone to pop in and visit your small animal/cat while you are away, we can most likely help.

Our pop in visits cost £10 (a little more if you are further away) and last for about 20 minutes. If you would like a much longer visit, we'll need to charge you our hourly rate, £15 per hour.

If you have a small animal not listed, do [get in touch](/contactus/), we may be able to help.
