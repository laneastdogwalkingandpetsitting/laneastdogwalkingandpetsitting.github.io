title: Daytime pet sitting
---
Pet sitting during the day is where we stay at your home to look after your pets/animals.  This is a fixed charge of £15 per hour and does not depend on how many pets/animals you have.

If you would like us to walk your dogs for an hour, we can do this too. If you have one dog, this can be done at no extra cost, but if you have more than one, our additional dog rate of £6 per dog applies.
