title: Overnight pet sitting

<img src="/assets/images/hannahwithsleepydog60pc.jpg" style="float:right; padding:10px">
Overnight pet sitting is a service where Hannah (Rich stays at home to look after our pets) stays at your home overnight to look after your pets while you are away.

We charge Â£65 per night which is a fixed charge and does not depend on how many pets/animals you have.

The pet sitting is from 6pm until 8am the following morning and includes feeding your pets. Unfortunately we cannot include any dog walking services in the overnight pet sitting. if you require your dog to be walked during the day, the normal dog walking fee applies - [see pricelist](/prices/).
