Terms and conditions in relation to our services:

*By 'visit', we mean the service we are providing for you: dog walk, pet sit, pop-in etc.

### Cancellations.

We reserve the right to charge for any visit cancelled with less than 24 hours notice - this is because we will have missed the opportunity for a job elsewhere and therefore loss of income. This includes any visit where we arrive at the property and find we are unable to access the property via the agreed method, eg the key is missing or not left as agreed, or no answer at the door. We will attempt to call the customer to see if there has been a change, eg key is now kept in a different location, but if we still cannot gain access (or cannot get in touch), we will still need to charge for the visit.

### Payment.

We ask for payment by Friday of the week the service was provided . For example if we walk your dog on Monday and Wednesday, please pay by Friday.

Thank you for your understanding.
