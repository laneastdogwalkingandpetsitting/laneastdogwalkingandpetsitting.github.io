title: Take your pet to the vets if you are unable to
---
Some of my customers have a pet, but they are unable to drive, so I help them out by taking their pet to the vet when they need to. I realised this may be something useful for other people too. If you can't drive, or you need to go to work, I might well be able to help you out. Perhaps you just need someone to collect your pet from the vets and take them home.

I charge my standard rate of Â£15 per hour.

If this sounds like something that could be helpful, let me know [get in touch](/contactus/), we may be able to help.
