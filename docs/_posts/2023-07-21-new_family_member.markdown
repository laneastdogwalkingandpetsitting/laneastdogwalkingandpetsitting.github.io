We would like to introduce a new member of our family, Harper. Harper is a chocolate Labrador from 
the [Labrador Rescue Trust](https://labrador-rescue.org/). Once she's settled in, we hope to bring her out in group walks 
for those customers who have asked us to help socialise their dog as well not just walk them.
