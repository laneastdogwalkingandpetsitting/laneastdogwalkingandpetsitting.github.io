Hi everyone. During this really hot spell, we are reorganising our dog walks to try to get all our customers dogs walked before it gets too hot in a morning, eg all dogs walked by 11am where we can. 

For those customers who there isn't someone at home during the day, we'll be doing free of charge pop-in checks later on to allow your dog(s) to pop outside to do its business.
